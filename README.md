# Predicting Nighttime Lights

Data Science project predicting nighttime lights in the United States 4 years in the future.

My [report](https://github.com/Patricol/Predicting-Nighttime-Lights/blob/master/Report.pdf) explains the methodology and results of this project in more detail.

The ipynb file is meant for use with Jupyter.

I've also converted it into a regular py file for convenience's sake.
